// rootCmd represents the base command when called without any subcommands
var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "eec",
	Short: "Environment Execution Controller — run isolated environments safely",
	Long: `eec (env-exec) is a Go-based Environment Execution Controller.

It allows you to safely manage and execute environments defined in TOML, YAML, or JSON
configuration files without polluting your system environment.

With eec, you can:
  • Run programs within temporary, isolated environments
  • Group multiple configurations under tags for easy access
  • Generate utility scripts for quick launching
  • Use interactive (REPL) or restart modes for flexible workflows
  • Build CLI, GUI, and libraries via mage

Examples:
  eec run --config-file dev.toml --program cmd
  eec tag add dev --import base-dev.toml --import go-dev.toml
  eec run --tag dev
  eec gen script
  eec repl

eec is designed for developers who need clean, reproducible multi-language
development environments without touching the global system state.`,
